PUT /driver/availability - This API interface will allow the driver to mark when they are ready to take a ride. They can set their availability status to 'online' or 'offline' as per their preference.

By exposing these API interfaces, we can build a robust driver onboarding module that will enable us to collect the necessary information, verify the driver's credentials, and make them available to accept ride requests.
